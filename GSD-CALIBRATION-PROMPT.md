# Repository Calibration Prompt

> Apply this prompt to any codebase to refactor it toward the architectural principles, quality standards, and operational patterns derived from the Get Shit Done (GSD) framework. Feed this prompt to an AI coding assistant alongside the target repo.

---

## PROMPT

You are calibrating a repository to align with a set of engineering principles. Analyze the target codebase first, then apply the standards below — but only where they fit. These are principles, not a universal checklist. Every change must serve a concrete purpose for this specific repo.

**Before applying any section, answer:** Does this principle improve this repo, or am I force-fitting a standard that doesn't belong here?

---

### 0. APPLICABILITY FILTER

Not every section applies to every repo. Use this filter before applying each section:

| Repo type | Apply sections | Skip or reduce |
|---|---|---|
| Small script/CLI (<500 LOC) | 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | 1 (minimal), 2 (skip), 4 (skip if no tests), 10 (skip), 11 (skip) |
| Library/package | 1 (adapted), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | 10 (minimal), 11 (skip) |
| Web application | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 | 11 (only if multi-agent) |
| Monorepo | Apply per-package where possible | Single `.planning/` at root; adapt naming/structure rules per package's language conventions |
| AI agent system | All sections | — |

**Team context matters:**
- Solo developer + AI: apply git/branch rules as written.
- Team repo with existing PR process, branch protection, release trains: preserve the team's git workflow. Apply code quality, verification, and planning principles but do not override established team git conventions.

**Language adaptation:**
- Naming conventions (Section 1) apply to `.planning/` artifacts and project-level config. Source code naming follows the target language's idioms (PascalCase React components, snake_case Python modules, etc.).
- Stub detection patterns (Section 4) must be adapted to the target language. The examples given are JS/React-specific. Derive equivalent patterns for the actual language.

---

### 1. PROJECT STRUCTURE

Organize planning artifacts into a persistent state directory:

```
.planning/                       # Persistent project state (never deleted)
  PROJECT.md                     # Vision, core value prop, audience, constraints
  REQUIREMENTS.md                # Atomic requirements with IDs (REQ-CATEGORY-NN)
  ROADMAP.md                     # Phase structure with goal-backward success criteria
  STATE.md                       # Living memory: current position, decisions, blockers
  config.json                    # Workflow preferences (depth, mode, model profile)
  research/                      # Discovery and research outputs
  phases/{NN}-{name}/            # Per-phase plans, summaries, verification
  codebase/                      # Architecture, conventions, stack, concerns docs
```

**Naming rules:**
- `.planning/` artifacts use UPPER_CASE.md for top-level documents (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, SUMMARY.md, VERIFICATION.md) and kebab-case for directories and secondary files.
- Source code files follow the target language's conventions. Do not rename existing source files to kebab-case if the language/framework has a different standard (PascalCase React components, snake_case Python, etc.).
- Zero-pad phase numbers: `01`, `02`, `08`.

**Requirement rules:**
- One capability per requirement. Requirements are user-centric ("User can X"), specific, testable, and atomic.
- Every v1 requirement maps to exactly one phase. No orphans, no duplicates.
- Phase goals are outcomes, not tasks. Good: "Users can securely access their accounts." Bad: "Build authentication."

**Scaling guidance:**
- Repos under 500 LOC: a single PROJECT.md may suffice. Skip REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, and phase directories unless the project is expected to grow significantly.
- Repos 500–5000 LOC: PROJECT.md + REQUIREMENTS.md + ROADMAP.md. Phase directories as needed.
- Repos over 5000 LOC or with multiple contributors: full `.planning/` structure.
- Monorepos: single `.planning/` at repo root. Per-package planning only if packages are independently versioned and released.

---

### 2. PLANNING METHODOLOGY

Use **goal-backward decomposition**, not forward planning.

- **Forward (wrong):** "What should we build?" produces task lists.
- **Goal-backward (right):** "What must be TRUE when this is done?" produces success criteria that tasks must satisfy.

**Phase derivation:**
- Derive phases from requirements — never impose a generic structure like "Setup → Core → Features → Polish."
- Group requirements by natural delivery boundaries.
- Prefer vertical slices (model + API + UI for one feature) over horizontal layers (all models, then all APIs, then all UI).
- Depth controls compression, not inflation. Never pad to hit a target number.

**Plan sizing:**
- 2–3 tasks per plan maximum. No exceptions.
- Each task: concrete enough that a different person/agent could execute it without clarifying questions.
- Tasks touching more than 5 files are too large — split them.
- Discovery and implementation never share a plan.

**Split signals (always split if):**
- More than 3 tasks
- Multiple subsystems (DB + API + UI = separate plans)
- Any task modifying more than 5 files
- Checkpoint + implementation in same plan

**Task specificity test:**

| Too vague | Right level |
|---|---|
| "Add authentication" | "Add JWT auth with refresh rotation using jose, httpOnly cookie, 15min access / 7day refresh" |
| "Create the API" | "Create POST /api/projects accepting {name, password}, validate name 3–50 chars, return 201" |
| "Handle errors" | "Wrap API calls in try/catch, return {error: string} on 4xx/5xx, show toast via sonner" |

---

### 3. EXECUTION STANDARDS

**Atomic commits:**
- One commit per completed task. No batching.
- Format: `{type}({scope}): {description}`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `revert`, `perf`, `style`
- Stage files individually. NEVER use `git add .`, `git add -A`, or broad directory adds.

**Deviation rules during execution (not during calibration — see Section 12):**

These rules apply when executing planned work against this repo. During calibration itself, the scope is limited to structure, conventions, and quality — not feature implementation.

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Bug found (logic error, type error, null pointer, security vuln) | Auto-fix immediately. No permission needed. |
| Missing critical functionality (no input validation, no auth on protected route, missing error handling) | Auto-add immediately. No permission needed. |
| Blocking issue (missing dep, broken import, wrong config) | Auto-fix immediately. No permission needed. |
| Architectural change (new DB table, switching library, changing API contract) | STOP. Present to user. Wait for decision. |

Priority: architectural changes override auto-fix rules. When in doubt, ask.

**Scope boundary for auto-fix vs. code quality rules:** Section 6 says "do not add features beyond what was requested." The deviation rules above apply only to work discovered *during execution of a planned task*. They do not authorize proactive feature additions during unrelated work. If you find a security vulnerability while refactoring file naming, log it as a gap — don't fix it in the naming commit.

**Context budget discipline:**
- Target completion within 50% context usage.
- Plans are capped at 2–3 tasks specifically to keep executors in the quality zone.
- Fresh context per execution unit — do not accumulate stale context across unrelated work.

| Context usage | Quality | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 0–30% | Peak | Full thoroughness |
| 30–50% | Good | Target completion zone |
| 50–70% | Degrading | Wrap up |
| 70%+ | Poor | Rushed, error-prone — stop |

---

### 4. VERIFICATION STANDARDS

**Core principle:** Task completion does NOT equal goal achievement. Verify outcomes, not activity.

**Three-level artifact verification:**

| Level | Check | Question |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Existence | File exists on disk | "Is the file there?" |
| 2. Substantive | Real implementation, not a stub | "Does it do something?" |
| 3. Wired | Imported AND used by other code | "Is it connected?" |

**Minimum substantive thresholds (adapt to language — these are baselines):**
- Component/view: 15+ lines
- API route/handler: 10+ lines
- Hook/utility/helper: 10+ lines
- Schema/model/type definition: 5+ lines

These are heuristics, not hard rules. A 12-line component that does real work is better than a 50-line component padded to hit a threshold.

**Artifact status matrix:**

| Exists | Substantive | Wired | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Y | Y | Y | VERIFIED |
| Y | Y | N | ORPHANED |
| Y | N | — | STUB |
| N | — | — | MISSING |

**Stub red flags — adapt these patterns to the target language:**

JavaScript/React:
- `return <div>Component</div>` or `return <div>Placeholder</div>`
- `onClick={() => {}}` (empty handler)
- `return Response.json({ message: "Not implemented" })`
- `return Response.json([])` with no actual data query

Python:
- `pass` as sole function body
- `raise NotImplementedError` in production code (not abstract base classes)
- `return {}` or `return []` with no computation
- `# TODO` as sole function body

Go:
- `return nil, nil` ignoring actual logic
- Empty interface implementations
- `panic("not implemented")`

General (any language):
- `fetch`/`request`/`http.get` with no assignment or error handling
- Query constructed but result not returned
- State/variable assigned but never read
- Console/print/log as sole implementation

**Goal-backward must-haves:**
- **Truths**: 3–7 observable behaviors from user perspective per phase
- **Artifacts**: Specific files with expected exports, minimum lines, real content
- **Key links**: Critical connections verified (component→API, API→DB, form→handler, state→render)

Key links are where 80% of stubs hide. Never skip link verification.

---

### 5. GIT AND BRANCH STRATEGY

**Default model (solo or small team without existing conventions):**

Two branches: `main` and feature branches. No `develop`. No release branches.

**Branch naming:**
- `feat/description` — new capability
- `fix/description` — bug fix
- `docs/description` — documentation only
- `refactor/description` — internal change, no behavior change
- `hotfix/version-description` — emergency fix

**Main branch rules:**
- No direct commits (forces checkpoint thinking)
- PRs required (creates revert points)
- Must pass CI

**If the repo already has an established git workflow** (protected branches, required reviewers, release branches, CI gates): preserve it. Apply commit message format and atomic commit discipline within the existing workflow. Do not restructure a team's branching model during calibration.

**Versioning:**
- Breaking change → MAJOR (X.0.0)
- New feature → MINOR (1.X.0)
- Bug fix → PATCH (1.9.X), batched weekly unless critical
- Documentation/refactor → no version bump

---

### 6. CODE QUALITY RULES

**Do:**
- Write code that works, not code that looks impressive.
- Make every function/module do one thing well.
- Name things precisely. If you can't name it clearly, you don't understand it yet.
- Validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Trust internal code.
- Delete unused code completely. No `_unused` variables, no `// removed` comments, no re-exports of deleted things.

**Do not:**
- Add features, refactoring, or "improvements" beyond what was requested.
- Add docstrings/comments/type annotations to code you didn't change.
- Add error handling for scenarios that cannot happen.
- Create abstractions for one-time operations.
- Design for hypothetical future requirements.
- Add feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.
- Over-engineer. Three similar lines are better than a premature abstraction.

---

### 7. LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION STANDARDS

**Imperative voice. Technical precision. No filler.**

Banned phrases:
- "Let me", "Just", "Simply", "Basically", "I'd be happy to"
- "Great!", "Awesome!", "Excellent!", "I'd love to help"
- "We changed X to Y", "Previously", "No longer", "Instead of" (except in changelogs)

**Commit message quality:**
- Good: "JWT auth with refresh rotation using jose library"
- Bad: "Phase complete" or "Authentication implemented"

**Requirement quality:**
- Good: "User can reset password via email link"
- Bad: "Handle password reset"

---

### 8. BANNED PATTERNS

These are explicitly prohibited. Remove them if found during refactoring:

**Enterprise theater:**
- Story points, sprint ceremonies, RACI matrices
- Human dev time estimates (days/weeks) — estimate in execution time if needed
- Team coordination docs, knowledge transfer docs (in a solo-dev context)
- Change management processes, release committees (in a solo-dev context)
- Stakeholder management, risk matrices, Gantt charts
- Multi-week stabilization branches, change advisory boards

**Note:** Some of these (team coordination docs, release processes) are legitimate in team contexts. Only ban them in solo-dev or small-team repos where they are pure overhead.

**Code anti-patterns:**
- `git add .` or `git add -A` (always stage individually)
- Vague task descriptions ("Add authentication", "Handle errors")
- Horizontal decomposition over vertical slices
- Forward planning over goal-backward decomposition
- Trusting completion claims without verifying actual artifacts
- Running the app for verification when structural checks (grep, file reads) suffice

**Checkpoint anti-patterns:**
- Asking a human to do work that can be automated
- Checkpoints before automation completes (automate first, verify after)
- Too many checkpoints (verification fatigue)
- Mixing multiple verifications in a single checkpoint

---

### 9. DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY

Use the scientific method. Never guess.

1. **Gather symptoms** — what happened, what was expected
2. **Form falsifiable hypotheses** — "State resets when route changes" not "Something is wrong with state"
3. **Test each hypothesis** — prediction → setup → measurement → observation → conclusion
4. **Eliminate systematically** — track what was ruled out and why

**Investigation techniques (in order of preference):**
1. Binary search — divide problem space repeatedly
2. Working backwards — start from desired output, trace to divergence
3. Minimal reproduction — strip to bare essentials
4. Differential debugging — compare working vs. broken
5. Observability first — add logging before changing behavior

**Fix verification (all must be true):**
- Original issue gone
- Root cause understood (not just symptoms treated)
- Related functionality still works
- Stable across repeated testing

---

### 10. STATE PRESERVATION

Every meaningful decision, blocker, and progress marker must persist to disk. Context will be lost — files survive.

- **STATE.md** — living memory across sessions: current position, accumulated decisions, blockers, progress
- **SUMMARY.md per plan** — what was built, commit hashes, deviations from plan
- **VERIFICATION.md per phase** — what passed, what has gaps, what needs human review
- **config.json** — workflow preferences that apply across all phases

Commit state artifacts immediately after creation. If context is lost mid-session, artifacts on disk are the recovery mechanism.

**For small repos (under 500 LOC):** a single STATE.md at the project root may be sufficient. Do not create a full `.planning/` hierarchy for a project that doesn't need it.

---

### 11. MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION

**Apply this section only if** the target repo involves AI agent coordination, multi-agent workflows, or prompt orchestration systems. Skip entirely for standard applications, libraries, CLIs, and services.

- **Orchestrator stays lean.** It routes work, it doesn't do work.
- **Each executor gets a fresh context.** Never accumulate unrelated context across agents.
- **Wave-based parallelism:** group independent plans into waves. All plans in a wave run in parallel. Waves execute sequentially.
- **Structured returns:** every agent returns a parseable status header (`COMPLETE`, `BLOCKED`, `ISSUES FOUND`, `CHECKPOINT REACHED`) so the orchestrator can programmatically route next actions.
- **Content must be inlined when spawning subagents.** Lazy-load references (like `@file` syntax) do not cross agent boundaries.

---

### 12. APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS

**Ordering:** Apply sections in this order. Each category must be stable before moving to the next.

1. **Structural** (Sections 1, 5): file organization, naming, git setup
2. **Quality** (Sections 6, 8): code anti-patterns, dead code, stubs
3. **Process** (Sections 2, 3): planning methodology, execution standards
4. **Verification** (Section 4): tests, CI, artifact verification
5. **Communication** (Section 7): language standards, commit messages
6. **Operational** (Sections 9, 10, 11): debugging, state, orchestration

**Steps:**

1. **Audit first.** Map the existing codebase structure, conventions, stack, and concerns before changing anything.
2. **Filter by applicability.** Use Section 0 to determine which sections apply. Document which sections you're skipping and why.
3. **Identify gaps.** Compare current state against applicable sections. Document what's missing, what violates standards, what's already aligned.
4. **Prioritize by impact.** Critical gaps (broken tests, security issues, missing .gitignore) before style preferences.
5. **Apply incrementally.** One category at a time. Atomic commits per change. Verify each change before proceeding.
6. **Do not over-apply.** If a principle doesn't improve this specific repo, skip it.

**Calibration scope limits:**
- Calibration addresses structure, conventions, and quality. It does NOT implement features, write business logic, or make architectural decisions.
- If you discover bugs or security issues during calibration, log them in `.planning/STATE.md` as gaps. Do not fix them in calibration commits unless they are trivial (broken import, missing .gitignore entry).
- If a transformation breaks the build or tests: `git revert` the offending commit, log the issue in STATE.md, and ask the user how to proceed. Do not attempt more than one fix without user input.

**Conflict resolution:**
- Existing tooling (Prettier, ESLint, Black, rustfmt, etc.) takes precedence over style preferences in this prompt. Do not fight the formatter.
- Existing CI configuration takes precedence over git workflow recommendations. Add to CI, don't restructure it.
- Language idioms take precedence over naming conventions in this prompt for source code files. `.planning/` artifacts follow this prompt's conventions.

**Done condition:** Calibration is complete when:
- All applicable sections have been audited
- All critical and high-priority gaps have been addressed (or explicitly deferred with documented reasoning)
- All existing tests still pass
- All existing builds still succeed
- `.planning/CALIBRATION-AUDIT.md` documents what was done, what was skipped, and what remains

**Resuming interrupted calibration:** If context is lost mid-calibration, read `.planning/STATE.md` and `.planning/CALIBRATION-AUDIT.md` to determine current position. Do not restart from Phase 1. Continue from the last documented checkpoint.
