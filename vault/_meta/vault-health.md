# Vault Health Dashboard

Updated by `/vault-maintain`. Metrics below are populated on each maintenance run.

## Note Counts

| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| Atoms | 0 |
| Tensions | 0 |
| Encounters | 1 |
| Positions | 1 |
| Questions | 1 |
| Revisions | 0 |
| Anti-library | 0 |
| Falsifications | 1 |
| **Total** | **4** |

## Orphans (zero inbound links)

_vault-health.md (meta documentation, acceptable)_
_encounters/2026-02-14-designing-the-cognitive-vault.md (first encounter, awaiting references)_

**Action:** No immediate action needed. First encounter will accumulate inbound links as vault grows.

## Stale Notes (`#status/working` older than 30 days)

_None. All notes created today._

## Unverified Assumptions

_None. No `#status/unverified` notes yet._

## Emerging Patterns

_Insufficient data. Need 3+ encounters over time to extract patterns._

## Broken Links (Intentional Signal)

The following links intentionally point to non-existent notes (per conventions):
- `[[atoms/hyrums-law]]` — referenced in what-good-code-actually-is.md
- `[[tensions/abstraction-vs-explicitness]]` — referenced in what-good-code-actually-is.md

**Recommendation:** Create these notes to resolve the position's reasoning.

## Last Maintenance Run
