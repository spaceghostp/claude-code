# Things I Was Wrong About

#status/working — This is a living log. Entries accumulate over time.

A record of beliefs that changed, with links to the reasoning. The purpose is not self-flagellation — it's pattern extraction. Over time, this log should reveal *how* I'm wrong, not just *that* I'm wrong. Consistent error patterns are more valuable than any individual correction.

## Entry Template

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]

**Old belief:** [what I believed]
**New belief:** [what I believe now]
**What caused the change:** [encounter, evidence, argument]
**Revision note:** [[revisions/YYYY-MM-DD-revised-on-topic]]
**Error type:** [premature certainty | missing evidence | wrong abstraction level | ...]
```
